### loops

# fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
# for fruit in  fruits:
#     print(fruit)
### This for loop assignes the value of "fruit" to the first item in "fruits" 
### and then prints it. It then goes to the second item and does the same.
### This is like writing:
# fruit = "Apple"
# print(fruit)
# fruit = "Peach"
# print(fruit)
# fruit = "Pear"
# print(fruit)
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for fruit in  fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")
